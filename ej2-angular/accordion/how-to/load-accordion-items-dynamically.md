# Load accordion items dynamically in Angular Accordion component

Accordion items can be added dynamically by passing the item and index value with the [`addItem`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/accordion#additem) method.

In the following demo, you can add the accordion content by expanding any accordion header content using
[`expanded`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/accordion#expanded) event.

* Data is fetched from the data source.

* The data is formatted as a JSON object with [`header`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/accordion/accordionItem#header)
and [`content`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/accordion/accordionItem#content) fields.

* Here last index is calculated to append the new accordion at the end.
