# Set custom animation in Angular Accordion component

Accordion supports custom animations for both expand and collapse actions from the provided animation option of `Animation` library.
The [`animation`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/accordion#animation) property also allows you to set [`easing`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/accordion/accordionActionSettingsModel#easing), [`duration`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/accordion/accordionActionSettingsModel#duration), and various other effects of your choice.

Default animation is given as `SlideDown` for expanding the panel using [`expand`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/accordion/accordionAnimationSettingsModel#expand) animation property and `SlideUp` for collapsing the panel using [`collapse`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/accordion/accordionAnimationSettingsModel#collapse) animation property. You can also disable the animation by setting animation [`effect`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/accordion/accordionActionSettingsModel#effect) as `none`.

The sample demonstrates some types of animation that suits for Accordion. You can check all the animation effects here.
