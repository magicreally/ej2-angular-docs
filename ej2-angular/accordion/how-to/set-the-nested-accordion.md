# Set the nested accordion in Angular Accordion component

You can render Accordion components inside the parent Accordion content using Angular **ng-template**. Through this, we can add content as Accordion components directly with all their functionalities to our Accordion. We need to use `ng-template` inside the each `e-accordionitem` tag with `#content` attribute, which is mandatory to render content. And now use `ng-template` tag with select attribute of id or class name for mapping required content.
