# Change the first day of week in Angular Calendar component

The Calendar provides an option to change the first day of the week by using the [`firstDayOfWeek`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/calendar#firstdayofweek) property.
Day of the week starts from 0(Sunday) to 6(Saturday).

> By default, the first day of week will be based on culture.

The following example demonstrates the Calendar with `Tuesday` as first day of the week.
