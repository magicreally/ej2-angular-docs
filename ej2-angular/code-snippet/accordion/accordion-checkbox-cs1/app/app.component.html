                Microsoft ASP.NET is a set of technologies in the Microsoft .NET
                Framework for building Web applications and XML Web services.
                ASP.NET pages execute on the server and generate markup such as
                HTML, WML, or XML that is sent to a desktop or mobile browser.
                ASP.NET pages use a compiled,event-driven programming model that
                improves performance and enables the separation of application
                logic and user interface.

                The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern separates an
                application into three main components: the model, the view, and
                the controller. The ASP.NET MVC framework provides an alternative
                to the ASP.NET Web Forms pattern for creating Web applications.
                The ASP.NET MVC framework is a lightweight, highly testable
                presentation framework that (as with Web Forms-based applications)
                is integrated with existing ASP.NET features, such as master pages
                and membership-based authentication.

                JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted computer programming language.It
                was originally implemented as part of web browsers so that
                client-side scripts could interact with the user, control the
                browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document
                content that was displayed.More recently, however, it has become
                common in both game development and the creation of desktop
                applications.
