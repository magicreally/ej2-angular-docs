# Disable placeholder readonly in Angular Datetimepicker component

Property | Purpose
-----|-----
[`enabled`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/datetimepicker#enabled) | The component can be restricted on a page, by setting `enabled` value as **false** which will disable the component completely from all user interactions including in form post action.
[`placeholder`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/datetimepicker#placeholder) | Using `placeholder` you can display a short hint about the expected value in the input element.
[`readonly`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/datetimepicker#readonly)       | Editing the value in the component can be prevented by setting `readonly` as **true**, but value can be included in the form post action.
