# Two way binding in Angular Datetimepicker component

The following example demonstrates how to achieve **two-way binding** by binding the **value** to the first DateTimePicker component by using property binding and binding the model data using **ngModel** by using model binding to the DateTimePicker component. The **value** of the DateTimePicker will get change, when their is any change in the property value or model value.

> The two-way binding can also be achieved only by using **property binding** or **model binding** in the DateTimePicker component.
