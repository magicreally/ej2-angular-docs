# Index in Angular Drop down list component

The Angular DropDownList component contains a list of predefined values from which a single value can be chosen. The functionality of DropDownList resembles the SELECT form element of HTML. When an arrow icon accompanied with this component is pressed, the dropdown displays a list of values from which you can select one.

## Key features

* [**Data binding**](./data-binding/) - Allows to bind and access the list of items from the local or server-side data source.

* [**Grouping**](./grouping/) - Supports grouping the logically related items under a single or specific category.

* [**Sorting**](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/drop-down-list/#sortorder) - Supports sorting of list items in an alphabetical order (either ascending or descending).

* [**Filtering**](./filtering/) -  Allows filtering of list items based on a character typed into the search box.

* [**Templates**](./templates/) -  Allows customizing the list items, selected value, header, footer, category group header, and no records content.

* [**Accessibility**](./accessibility/) - Provided with built-in accessibility support that helps to access all the Angular DropDownList component features through the keyboard, screen readers, or other assistive technology devices.
