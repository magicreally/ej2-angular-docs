# Drag and drop in Angular File manager component

The file manager allows files or folders to be moved from one folder to another by using the  [allowDragAndDrop](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/file-manager/#allowdraganddrop) property. It also supports uploading a file by dragging it from Windows Explorer to  FileManager control. You can enable or disable this support by using the [allowDragAndDrop](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/file-manager/#allowdraganddrop) property of file manager.

The event triggered in drag and drop support are

* [fileDragStart](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/file-manager/#filedragstart) - Triggers when the file/folder dragging is started.
* [fileDragging](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/file-manager/#filedragging) - Triggers while dragging the file/folder.
* [fileDragStop](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/file-manager/#filedragstop) - Triggers when the file/folder is about to be dropped at the target.
* [fileDropped](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/file-manager/#filedropped) - Triggers when the file/folder is dropped.
