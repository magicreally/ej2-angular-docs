# Multiple selection in Angular File manager component

The file manager allows you to select multiple files by enabling the [allowMultiSelection](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/file-manager/#allowmultiselection) property (enabled by default). The multiple selection can be done by pressing the `Ctrl` key or `Shift` key and selecting the files. The check box can also be used to do multiple selection. `Ctrl + A` can be used to select all files in the current directory. The [fileSelect](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/file-manager/#fileselect) event will be triggered when the items of file manager control is selected or unselected.
