# Customize the edit dialog in Angular Grid component

You can customize the appearance of the edit dialog in the [`actionComplete`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/grid/#actioncomplete) event based on **requestType** as **beginEdit** or **add**.

In the following example, the dialog's properties like header text, showCloseIcon, height have been changed while editing and adding the records.

Also the locale text for the **Save** and **Cancel** buttons has been changed by overriding the default locale strings.

You can refer the Grid [`Default text`](../global-local/) list for more localization.
