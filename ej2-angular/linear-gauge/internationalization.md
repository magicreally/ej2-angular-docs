# Internationalization in Angular Linear gauge component

Globalization is the process of designing and developing a component that works in different cultures. Internationalization is used to globalize the number content in Linear Gauge component using [`format`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/linear-gauge/label/#format) property in [`ejs-lineargauge`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/linear-gauge/linearGaugeModel/).  It has static text on some features such as

* Axis label

The static text on above features can be changed to any culture such as Arabic, Deutsch and French. To know more about the globalization in Angular components, refer [here](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/common/internationalization/).
