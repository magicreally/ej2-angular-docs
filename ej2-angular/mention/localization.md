# Localization in Angular Mention component

The Localization library allows you to localize static text content of the [noRecordsTemplate](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/mention/#norecordstemplate) &nbsp;properties according to the culture currently assigned to the Mention.

| Locale key | en-US (default)  |
|------|------|
| noRecordsTemplate |  No records found |

## Loading translations

To load the translation object to your application, use the load function of the **L10n** class.

In the following sample, French culture is set to the mention component and no data is loaded. Hence, the [noRecordsTemplate](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/mention/#norecordstemplate) property displays its text in French culture initially.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.component.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/mention/getting-started-cs8/app/app.component.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.module.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/mention/getting-started-cs8/app/app.module.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="main.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/mention/getting-started-cs8/app/main.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
  
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/mention/getting-started-cs8" %}
