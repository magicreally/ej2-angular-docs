# Member filtering in Angular Pivotview component

Member filtering allows you to view pivot table with particular records based on filter criteria. You can disable the member filter by setting the [`allowMemberFilter`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/pivotview/dataSourceSettings/#allowmemberfilter) property to **false**. By default, this property is set as **true**.

## Filtering through UI

Filtering can also be performed through UI option available in [`grouping bar`](./grouping-bar) and [`field list`](./field-list) at run time.

## Filtering through code

It can be configured using the `filterSettings` option through code-behind. The settings required to filter at initial rendering are:
* `name`: It allows to set field name.
* `type`: It allows to set filter type as either "Include" or "Exclude" to the field.
* `items`: It allows to set the filter members of the field.
