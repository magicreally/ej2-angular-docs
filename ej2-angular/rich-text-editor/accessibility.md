The Rich Text Editor component has been designed, keeping in mind the WAI-ARIA specifications and applies the WAI-ARIA roles, states and properties. This component is characterized by complete ARIA accessibility support that makes it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) or those who completely rely on keyboard navigation.
