# State persistence in Angular Schedule component

State persistence allowed Scheduler to retain the `currentView`, `selectedDate` and Scroll position values in the [`localStorage`](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp#) for state maintenance even if the browser is refreshed or if you move to the next page within the browser. This action is handled through the `enablePersistence` property which is set to false by default. When it is set to true, `currentView`, `selectedDate` and Scroll position values of the scheduler component will be retained even after refreshing the page.

> **Note**: Scheduler `id` is essential to set state persistence.

The following sample demonstrates how to set state persistence of the Scheduler component.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.component.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/default-cs62/app/app.component.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.module.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/default-cs62/app/app.module.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="main.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/default-cs62/app/main.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
  
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/samples/schedule/default-cs62" %}
