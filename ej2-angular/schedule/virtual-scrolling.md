# Virtual scrolling in Angular Schedule component

To achieve better performance in the Scheduler when loading a large number of resources and events, we have added virtual scrolling support in the timeline views to load a large set of resources and events instantly as you scroll. You can dynamically load large number of resources and events in timeline view of the Scheduler by setting `true` to the `allowVirtualScrolling` property within the timeline view-specific settings. The virtual loading of events is possible in Agenda view, by setting `allowVirtualScrolling` property to `true` within the agenda view specific settings.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.component.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/default-cs88/app/app.component.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.module.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/default-cs88/app/app.module.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="main.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/default-cs88/app/main.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
  
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/samples/schedule/default-cs88" %}

> For now, the virtual loading of resources and events is available only `TimelineDay`, `TimelineWeek`, `TimelineWorkWeek`, `TimelineMonth` and `TimelineYear` (Vertical Orientation alone) views. In the future, we plan to port the same virtual loading on all other applicable Scheduler views.
