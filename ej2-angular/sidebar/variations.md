# Variations in Angular Sidebar component

The Sidebar component's expand behaviour can be modified based on the purpose of use.

## Expanding types of Sidebar

The Sidebar can be set to initialize based on four different types that are consistent with the main component as explained below.

 | Item | Description |
|-----|-----|
| `Over` | Sidebar floats over the main content area.|
| `Push` | Sidebar pushes the main content area to appear side-by-side, and shrinks the main content within the screen width.|
| `Slide` |Sidebar translates the x and y positions of main content area based on the Sidebar width. The main content area will not be adjusted within the screen width. |
| `Auto` | Sidebar with `Over` type in mobile resolution, and `Push` type in other higher resolutions. |

> `Auto` is the default expand mode.

In the following sample, the types of Sidebar are demonstrated.
