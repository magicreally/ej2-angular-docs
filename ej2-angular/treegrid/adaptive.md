# Adaptive in Angular Treegrid component

The Tree Grid user interface (UI) was redesigned to provide an optimal viewing experience and improve usability on small screens.

## Render adaptive dialogs

When you enable the [`enableAdaptiveUI`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/treegrid/#enableadaptiveui) property, the tree grid will render the filter, sort, and edit dialogs in full screen for a better user experience. The following demo demonstrates this behaviour.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.component.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/treegrid/adaptive-cs1/app/app.component.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.module.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/treegrid/adaptive-cs1/app/app.module.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="main.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/treegrid/adaptive-cs1/app/main.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
  
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/treegrid/adaptive-cs1" %}
