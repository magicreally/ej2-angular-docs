# Customize the edit dialog in Angular Treegrid component

You can customize the appearance of the edit dialog in the [`actionComplete`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/treegrid/#actioncomplete) event based on **requestType** as **beginEdit** or **add**.

In the below example, we have changed the dialog's header text for editing and adding records.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.component.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/treegrid/refresh-cs6/app/app.component.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.module.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/treegrid/refresh-cs6/app/app.module.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="main.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/treegrid/refresh-cs6/app/main.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
  
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/treegrid/refresh-cs6" %}
