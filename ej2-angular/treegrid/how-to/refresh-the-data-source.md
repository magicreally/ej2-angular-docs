Add/delete the datasource record by using the following code.

```typescript

    const dataSource: object = extendArray((this.treegridObj as TreeGridComponent).dataSource as object[]);

    // Added New Record.
    (dataSource as object[]).unshift({ TaskID: 99, TaskName: "New Data", StartDate: new Date('02/03/2017'), Duration: 10 });

    // Delete record.
    (dataSource as object[]).splice(selectedRowIndex, 1);

```
