# Select treegrid rows based on certain condition in Angular Treegrid component

You can select the specific row in the Tree Grid based on a certain condition by using the [`selectRows`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/treegrid/#selectrows) method in the [`dataBound`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/treegrid/#databound) event of Tree Grid.

In the below demo, we have selected the Tree Grid rows only when *Duration* column value greater than *4*.
