# Immutable mode in Angular Treegrid component

The immutable mode optimizes the Tree Grid re-rendering performance by using the object reference and [`deep compare`](https://dmitripavlutin.com/how-to-compare-objects-in-javascript/#4-deep-equality) concept. When performing the Tree Grid actions, it will only re-render the modified or newly added rows and prevent the re-rendering of the unchanged rows.

To enable this feature, you have to set the [`enableImmutableMode`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/treegrid#enableimmutablemode) property as **true**.

>* This feature uses the primary key value for data comparison. So, you need to provide the [`isPrimaryKey`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/treegrid/column/#isprimarykey) column.
