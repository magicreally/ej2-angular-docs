# Loading animation in Angular Treegrid component

The tree grid has an option to show a loading indicator in-between the time of fetching the data and binding it to the tree grid during initial rendering or refreshing or after performing any tree grid action like sorting, paging and more. The tree grid supports two indicator types, which is achieved by setting the `loadingIndicator.indicatorType` property to Spinner or Shimmer. The default value of the indicator type is "Spinner."

In the following sample, the Shimmer indicator is displayed while the tree grid is loading and refreshing when using the remote data.

{% include code-snippet/treegrid/loading-animation-cs1/app/app.module.ts %}
