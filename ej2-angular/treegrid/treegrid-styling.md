> The style customization works only when we elevate the CSS to global scope using the encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None
> If you need to apply style for ViewEncapsulation other than None, use ng-deep like shown in the below example code snippet,

```css
::ng-deep .e-treegrid .e-altrow  {
    background-color: #fafafa;
