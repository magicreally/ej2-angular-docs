# Form support in Angular Uploader component

The uploader component works with HTML form like default file input.
The following configuration is must to make the uploader work inside the form.

    *   `saveUrl` and `removeUrl` must be null.
    *   `autoUpload` must be disabled.
    *   `name` attribute must be added in input element.

The selected or dropped files are received as a collection in form action when the form is submitted.
The form action handles the server-side operations that manage the file upload process.
When you reset the form, the file list and data will be cleared.

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.module.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/template-driven-cs1/app/app.module.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="main.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/template-driven-cs1/app/main.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
