# Achieve file upload programmatically in Angular Uploader component

You can upload a file programmatically using [upload](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/uploader/#upload) method.
The selected files data, get from [getFilesData](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/uploader/#getfilesdata) public method in uploader.

The upload method behaves differently based on its arguments.
* If this method receives any files as arguments, those files only start to upload.
* If it has no argument then all the selected files are will start to upload.
