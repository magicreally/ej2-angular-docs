# Check file size before uploading it in Angular Uploader component

By using [uploading](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/uploader/#uploading) event, you can get the file size before upload it to server.
File object contains the file size in bytes only.
You can convert the size to standard formats (`KB` or `MB`) using [bytesToSize](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/uploader/#bytestosize) method.
