# Sort the selected files in Angular Uploader component

You can sort the selected files in an uploader component by using the [selected](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/uploader/#selected) event. Refer to the following example.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.component.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/sorting-cs1/app/app.component.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.module.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/sorting-cs1/app/app.module.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="main.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/sorting-cs1/app/main.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
  
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/samples/uploader/sorting-cs1" %}
