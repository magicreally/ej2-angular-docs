# Validate image on drop in Angular Uploader component

The uploader component allows you to upload all type of images by setting **image/* ** to [allowedExtensions](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/uploader/#allowedextensions) property.
You can directly set it to `accept` attribute of uploader element.

By default, the behavior is working with select a file using browse button. But, this behavior doesnâ€™t support on drag and drop the files. You can handle this behavior manually using `selected` event by filtering the file types from application.

In the following example, validated image files using images/*. You are able to drag and drop the image files with extension of PNG, JPG, BPG, GIF and TIFF to upload it.
